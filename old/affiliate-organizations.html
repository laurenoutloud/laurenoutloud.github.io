						<h2>Software Development Club</h2>
						<p>Software Development Club allows students to get hands on experience by working in teams on various projects. This semester, I was a member of the iOS development team. Our goal was to develop a iPhone application that revolved around tutoring, and during the process I learned a lot about source/version control, I gained a better understanding of how to utilize GitHub, and I got to dig in deep into Xcode and all of its features. I also gained experience using Swift.</p>

						<h2>Society of Women Engineers</h2>
						<p>SWE has enabled me to network and connect with other females in engineering. I believe having a strong support group as a female engineering student is important, and SWE also is very active in the community. Grade school students travel from all over Texas to attend some of SWEs events that promote engineering amongsts young females- such as their "Catch the Engineering Bug" event.  </p>
