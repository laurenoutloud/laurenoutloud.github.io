				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Lauren Finley, and I am a software developer. I recently graduated from Texas Tech University on May 19th, 2018 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics and Japanese. I am currently seeking full-time employment opportunities both within the U.S. and abroad as an entry level software engineer.				</p>

				<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>
				I grew up as a military child alongside two brothers. Both of my parents were in the U.S. Army, and as a result our family moved every couple of years. In addition to the U.S., I have lived in Germany, South Korea, and Belgium, and have traveled to several other countries such as China, Italy, Austria, England, France, Spain, and Japan. I got to experience the world at such a young age, and those experiences made me love to meet new people, visit new places, and try new things.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon graduating from high school, I attended the University of Central Florida (UCF) for two years. Originally, I declared my major in biomedical sciences- but switched to computer science after my first year of college to pursue my passion. I joined the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at UCF, and I competed in my first programming competition hosted by Deloitte. It was a great experience, and it inspired me to want to program on a more competitive level. The fall of 2015, I transferred to Texas Tech University (TTU) to be closer to family and to take advantage of their study abroad programs. Since transferring to TTU, I have joined several computer science and engineering related organizations such as ACM @ TTU, Software Development Club, and the Society of Women Engineers. After completing my first year at TTU, I spent an entire academic year in Tokyo, Japan studying the Japanese language and culture. I recently completed my final semester of education at the undergraduate level, and I couldn't be more thrilled to be starting the next chapter of my life.				</p>

				<h2>Goals</h2>
				<p>The following are goals that I would like to accomplish within the next five years:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Become fluent in Japanese</li>
					<li>Become certified in at least one programming language</li>
					<li>Become certified in at least one developer skill set that is not a programming language</li>
					<li>Travel to at least three new countries</li>
					<li>Read 100 books</li>
				</ul>
                <br />
                <h2>Honors and Awards</h2>
								<p><strong>Institutional Honors.</strong> I graduated with honors cum laude from Texas Tech University. </p>
                <p><strong>Boren Scholarship.</strong> In April of 2016 I was selected as a recipient of the Boren Scholarship award for the amount of $20,000. This highly selective and prestigious award allowed me to study abroad in Japan for an entire academic year. More information can be found <a href="http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2016/05/scholarships" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Pegasus Gold Scholarship.</strong> The Pegasus Gold Scholarship is a four year academic scholarship offered by UCF to incoming freshman who excelled academically in high school. </p>
